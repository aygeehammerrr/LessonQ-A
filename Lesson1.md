1.  Explain the principles of statistical quality control. What are the tools used for this? Explain the principle of a control chart.

    In statistical quality control, decisions are made and plans are developed based on the collection and evaluation of actual data in the form of metrics, rather than intuition and experience. SQC follows the Shewhart cycle. The Shewhart cycle illustrates the following activity sequence: setting goals, assigning them to measurable milestones, and assessing the progress against those milestones. 

    SQC uses 7 tools at most. Pareto analysis, cause-and-effect diagram, flow chart, trend chart, histogram, scatter diagram, and control chart. 

    Control charts are tools used to determine if a process is in a state of control. If analysis of the control chart indicates that the process is currently under control, then no corrections or changes to process control parameters are needed or desired. 
    In addition, data from the process can be used to predict the future performance of the process. If the chart indicates that the monitored process is not in control, analysis of the chart can help determine the sources of variation, as this will result in degraded process performance. 
    A process that is stable but operating outside of desired needs to be improved through a deliberate effort to understand the causes of current performance and fundamentally improve the process.

2.  Explain the concept of lean principles.

    Lean is a customer-centric methodology used to continuously improve any process through the elimination of waste in everything you do. 
    Lean principles also follow 7 concepts/principles true to their names. These are: Eliminate waste, Build Quality in, 
    Create knowledge, Defer commitment, Deliver fast, Respect people, and Optimize the whole.
  

3.  What is an “Ishikawa” diagram? When should the Ishikawa diagram be used? Provide a procedure to construct an Ishikawa diagram. 

    It is a visual representation of cause and effect. A simple process would be shooting a free throw in outdoor basketball. (See image below)



4.  What is total quality management (TQM)? What is the difference between TQM and TQC?

    TQM is a continuous process of increasing the quality of the output by eliminating waste and the non-value adding activities in the system. 
    In organizational perspective, a quality product comes within a quality process, which means that quality should be built into the process. 
    Therefore, the process needs to be managed in order to have quality output. TQM expresses about continuous improvement in the processes
    while TQC is about maintaining the quality standards throughout the process.

5.  Explain the differences between validation and verification.

    In general perspective, validation concerns the evaluation of an output to know whether the product is built correctly satisfying the requirements given before development.
    Verification on the other hand evaluates if the product meets its intended purpose.

6.  Explain the differences between failure, error, and fault.

    Failure is the result of a fault obviously making it incorrect. 
    Fault is an incorrect step, process, or data definition in a computer program while an error is that part of the system state that may cause subsequent failure (in the absence of any corrective action. 
    Error can also be represented as a difference between a computed result and the correct result.

7.  What is a test case? What are the objectives of testing?

    A test case is a pair of input and its expected outcome. Test cases may differ depending if it tackles between stateless systems and state oriented system. 
    The objectives of testing are the following: to know if something works or if it doesn’t, to reduce the risk of failures and to reduce the cost of testing.

8.  Explain the concepts of unit, integration, system, acceptance, and regression testing.

    All of these testing fall into a hierarchy starting from unit testing which involves individual program units such as procedures/methods only. 
    Integration testing follows where modules are combined to make a larger subsystem to test. System testing involves a wide scope of testing specifically dealing with high- level design concerning functionality and load.
    Acceptance testing deals with the satisfaction of the customer’s expectations from the system. 
    Regression testing is basically happens in the first three tests in the hierarchy this test ensures that new updates in the system did not break its correctness by using test cases used in prior tests.

9.  What are the different sources from which test cases can be selected?

    The sources may range in the following: Requirement and functional specifications, Source code, Input and output domain, Operational profile, and Fault model.

10. What is the difference between fault injection and fault simulation?

    Fault injection is a technique for improving the coverage of a test by introducing faults to test code paths, in particular error handling code paths while in fault simulation there is a program modification but it is not guaranteed to lead to a faulty program. 

11. Explain the differences between structural and functional testing.

    Structural testing also known as white-box testing is focused on the internal aspect or source code of a program while functional testing examines the program from an external perspective and observing the visible outcome of it.

12. What are the strengths and weaknesses of automated testing and manual testing?

    Automation runs test cases significantly faster than human resources but after some time it is not helpful in UI testing where actual manual testing is needed. 
    Initial cost of automation testing is more than manual testing but is useful most of the time. Manual testing requires less cost but prone to mistakes committed by testers.
